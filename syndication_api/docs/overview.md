#Developer API

##OverView

The Syndication API is centered around MediaItems which are groups of data provided by various Government Agencies
including as HHS, FDA, CDC and NIH. These groups of data are all ingested into our system to allow anyone to access the 
content in real time.

Our Core Resource End Points support MediaItems in different groupings.
