# Microsites

## What are Microsites

Storefront Microsites are used to display carefully curated lists of MediaItems for people who want to save development
time. The Microsites use the Syndication API to display the most recent information on your desired topics. You may also
put your own Title, logo, and links on these sites. The following pictures show the different ways a microsite can 
be customized.
