Testing and Coverage
===================================================

Overview
---------------------------------------------------

The HHS Syndication system has automated tests implemented using Spock. Tests are run during each build by our [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org) continuous integration build server. The test reports for the snapshot builds of the system can be found below, along with [Cobertura](https://github.com/cobertura/cobertura) code coverage reports and [CodeNarc](https://github.com/CodeNarc/CodeNarc) static code analysis reports.
